There&#8217;s quite a few of us keeping the collective operational. We&#8217;re always working on something new whether it&#8217;s within the organization or outside. Here you&#8217;ll find a brief showcase of the projects we&#8217;re currently creating.

  * [Sam&#8217;s Roadtrip to Seattle](http://mapsam.com/maps/roadtrip) &#8211; Leaflet map with photos of key points during Sam&#8217;s move out West
  * [Web Basemaps](http://www.mapsam.com/mugs/apis/) &#8211; looking at different mapping APIs and establishing a basemap
  * [Mapsam Experiments](http://mapsam.com/mugs/index.php) &#8211; some other web-related experiments
  * [Where Are We From? [Interactive Map]](http://giscollective.org/where-are-we-from-an-interactive-map/) (outdated)
