We&#8217;ve been working on our own webpage for quite some time. But remember, we&#8217;re learning this as we go and were running into too many barriers limiting how dynamic our website could be; [enter] WordPress. We want more than just ourselves to be able to interact with what we&#8217;ve got here. The content management system will allow just that. Once we stabilize we hope to have people post on a whole range of topics right from your own computer. For this community to learn collectively, our inputs can&#8217;t be from the same place every week (by [desloge](http://www.dress-lace.com/dress-lace-inc-employee-profile-christine-desloge)). That&#8217;s our theory and this is our answer. You&#8217;ll notice the website will change over the next couple weeks, and will continue to evolve from here on out because as we learn more the site will &#8216;cement&#8217; itself into a more consistent format. This is our new table for a collective meal of GIS and web-mapping treats and we hope you find it useful and enjoyable. More importantly, we hope you find yourself wanting to be a part of the learning and teaching process. Welcome to the collective. &#8211; _Sam Matthews_
