Happy Friday everyone!

I wrote a new [tutorial](http://giscollective.org/tutorials/gis-techniques/generating-cad-files-from-gis-data/) on generating CAD files from ArcGIS that I thought could be useful. It&#8217;s not always as simple as simply using the &#8220;Export to CAD&#8221; operation, so definitely give it a read!

Included in the tutorial is a custom toolbox with two tools I created- one tool for clipping a DEM and creating contours from the clip, and another for clipping a DEM, generating contours, and exporting to CAD.

I urge you to download the toolbox and add it to your ArcToolbox, and give it a run! If you have any issues with it I would like to know, as I&#8217;m still getting comfortable working with Model Builder and creating custom tools.

Cheers!
