We&#8217;ve updated the [Leaflet: GeoJSON Data](http://giscollective.org/tutorials/web-mapping/leaflet-2/) tutorial to reflect the most recent update into 0.6 (0.6.4). This tutorial explains how to link and add a geojson structure as a variable into your Leaflet-based maps. The tutorial also explains how to interact and bind popups to the features within the map. Enjoy!
