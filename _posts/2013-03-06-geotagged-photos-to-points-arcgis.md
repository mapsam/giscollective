I was planning on making a post for how to use the new Geotagged Photos to Point tool in ArcGIS, but then I found this [tutorial](http://www.esri.com/news/arcwatch/0912/import-geotagged-photographs-into-arcmap.html) by ESRI. The tool is pretty handy if you have a camera that stores geographic coordinates in the pictures it takes.

Essentially, all you do is upload your pictures from your camera/phone to a folder on your computer, point the Geotagged Photos to Points tool to that directory, run the tool, and it automatically creates a point layer in ArcMap for you to work with.

Beware, this tool is new to 10.1 so this tool will not be natively installed if you haven&#8217;t upgraded yet.
