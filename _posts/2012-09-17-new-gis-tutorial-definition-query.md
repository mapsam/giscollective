I just published a short tutorial on how to use a [Definition Query](http://giscollective.org/tutorials/gis-techniques/definition-query/) to choose what features to display in ArcGIS.

This is a feature of the Layer Properties that I was just introduced to, and already am finding it incredibly useful for my day to day work.

As always, feedback is appreciated!
