Hey folks,

If you haven&#8217;t noticed by viewing this post, we&#8217;ve made some changes to the website. As we learn more and more about web development, we learn more and more about how to change the GISC site. The content hasn&#8217;t changed. Just the layout and look. There may be more changes over the next few weeks as we work out the kinks and get back to a fluid work-flow – you&#8217;ve been warned!

There has actually been one change to the content. What was &#8220;Hotkey Weekly&#8221; is now &#8220;Quick Tips&#8221; in the tutorials section. These quick tips are going to encompass more than just hotkeys (which will still be there) – they&#8217;ll be fast tips that we find ourselves using frequently and think you should as well. Check out the page, with a [new post](http://giscollective.org/tutorials/quick-tips/google-web-fonts/) on Google Web Fonts and how they can add more spice to your web pages. Find your favorite font on the [Google Web Fonts Page](http://www.google.com/webfonts).

Thanks for keeping up with us. Keep on mugging.
