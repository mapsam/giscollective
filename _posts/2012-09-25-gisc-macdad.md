Exciting news!

Recently, MACDAD (Madison Area Cartographic Design and Dissemination), a group of UW-Madison Cartography and GIS graduate students, merged with the GISC. This joining of the two groups will benefit all involved, and make the GISC a stronger and more diverse presence on campus. If you were previously involved in MACDAD, please contact Erin Hamilton to make sure you are added to the GISC listserv to receive all future updates and news.
