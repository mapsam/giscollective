Next week we&#8217;re happy to have a few fellas from the State Cartographer&#8217;s Office (SCO) of Wisconsin come in to talk about server-based hosting and database management. The talk will cover some cool uses of postGIS, a spatial subset of PostGreSQL, with a focus on the inner workings of the SCO itself. Despite our fascination with the client side of maps and data, none of it is going to work properly without the servers on the back-end dishing out the data effectively.

We&#8217;ll also be throwing together some new tutorials on how our new website (the one you&#8217;re on right now!) was set up, is working, and how it&#8217;s managed. This will cover choosing hosting packages, setting up a WordPress website with a SQL database (what a SQL database is) and how we&#8217;re customizing it for our own look.

For now, keep making the maps. Cheers.
