Getting base maps on your webpage can be a pain sometimes simply because you can&#8217;t remember how each API supports different tile providers. I&#8217;m starting a project on the side to begin providing a simple web-page that will allow folks to easily grab the necessary HTML and JS scripts to get your base map running so you don&#8217;t have to read through the &#8220;getting started&#8221; tutorials any longer. This project has only just begun and will only be as complete as time allows. For now I plan on getting all of the main APIs loaded. The next step will involve changing each API depending on the tile service you wish to use (i.e. Cloudmade, Google, Tilemill, OSM, etc) and how to style them appropriately.

Let me know what you think and if you have any ideas as to how to make this more robust/holistic, please do tell.
