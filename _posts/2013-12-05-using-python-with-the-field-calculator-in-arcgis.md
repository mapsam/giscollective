Mike from SoCalGIS.org just posted an excellent tutorial showing how one could use Python within the field calculator to break apart string values and add them to a new field.

For example, say you have a field with values such as &#8220;Census Tract 12345&#8243; and you want to have a field that only contains the tract number (e.g., 12345). You can use python within the field calculator to extract that third word from the field, pretty sweet!
