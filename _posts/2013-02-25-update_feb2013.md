I&#8217;m up in Seattle doing contract work for Google Maps during the day, but enjoy my evenings leading and creating through <a href="http://situatedlaboratories.com">Situated Laboratories</a> &#8211; founded with <a href="https://twitter.com/rgdonohue">Rich Donohue</a>. Chandler is living down in LA and working his socks off as a GIS technician with <a href="http://www.fuscoe.com/">Fuscoe Engineering</a> and managing to keep the tunage in his day-to-day with newly founded band, &#8220;Oh, Boy!&#8221;

We&#8217;ve been acclimating to our new cities and have struggled to keep the GISC on its feet – thanks to those who helped out back on campus. We&#8217;re going to try our best to bring the tree that is the GISC back into bloom as we roll into spring. We&#8217;ll be focusing less on the standardization our ideas and more on the sharing of them. We&#8217;re going to keep it simple from here.

Over the winter I put together a spoof ad campaign for the website, which I&#8217;m happy to still have the chance to use. I&#8217;ll post the next couple over the course of our re-boot so keep your eyes peeled for some inspirational mapping advertisements.
