One of our members, Carl Sack, has been doing quite a bit of research on Web Mapping Services (WMS) and has been compiling his research into a well structured series on their usage and components. Make sure to check out the series on the [tutorials page](http://giscollective.org/tutorials/web-mapping). Many thanks, Carl!
