Last night I published a new GIS Technique tutorial on using Model Builder in ArcGIS to automate repetitive tasks in your work. It is a lengthy tutorial (16 pages in GoogleDocs!) and I broke it into 9 sections to make it seem less intimidating.

The goal of the tutorial is to show how to identify potential habitat for a species in one county, and then create a tool to allow the user to identify habitat in other counties as well.

I would love feedback from anyone who completes it, such as how much time you spent on it, if I described something incorrectly, or if I left important information out.

Model Builder is an awesome tool that can really speed up your GIS analysis, especially if you&#8217;re performing repetitive tasks.

Cheers!
