For those of you planning on attending the NACIS 2012 Annual Conference in Portland&#8230; we&#8217;ll see you there! The GISC is excited to be traveling in heavy numbers. Many students from the University of Wisconsin and some professionals from the area will be showing their cartographic support to the mapping community. If you haven&#8217;t had the chance to attend a NACIS conference, or if you haven&#8217;t heard of NACIS &#8211; take a look at [their website](http://www.nacis.org/) &#8211; you&#8217;ll find how a little collaboration can go a long way. They&#8217;re definitely a great open-model organization producing some great products and cartographers in the field.

There&#8217;s much to be learned over the course of the conference, hopefully we can get some guest presenters to host some of their work on the website here for everyone to learn. Updates will be coming in hot over the next two weeks as we prepare more tutorials and tips for your mapping needs.

Happy mapping.
