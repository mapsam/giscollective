Maps are works of conscious design, and it is a good idea to be familiar with the impact you color scheme has on viewers of your map.

Humans react differently to different colors, and this infogram I happened upon by _Painters of Louisville_Â gives a nice summary of how colors affect human beings.

Happy Mapping!
