Today marks the first year anniversary of the GISCollective! One year ago our blog was created and we began helping each other **learn more**. Not only have we been learning more, we&#8217;ve been learning together. The GISC is much more than this simple website. It is every interaction on campus, every discussion or plea for help on gchat, and every critique and criticism that makes this collective whole.

Here&#8217;s to infinite [recursive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion) collaboration!

<pre>var collaboration = true;

if(collaboration){
  moreCollaboration();
}

function moreCollaboration(){
  happyHour();
  moreCollaboration();
}
</pre>

Thanks, everybody!
