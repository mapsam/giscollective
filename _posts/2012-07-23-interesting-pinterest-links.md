Check out this useful list of interactive mapping technologies on pinterest! Among other things, it has links to [leaflet vector layers](http://geojason.info/leaflet-vector-layers/), a useful javascript library for extending leaflet&#8217;s built in data import capabilities and a variety of tile creation tools that are similar to Tilemill.
