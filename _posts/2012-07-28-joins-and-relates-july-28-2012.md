This is a new section I wanted to start to share cool maps, new features in GIS and mapping services, and interesting articles on GIS and mapping. My goal is to help everyone stay in the loop in the world of GIS and mapping. Feel free to start discussions in the forums (GIS Chat) about the links posted here, the forums are pretty lonely so far <img src="http://giscollective.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
