For those typeface junkies out there, if you haven&#8217;t checked out [&#8220;The League of Moveable Type&#8221;](http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/) you should take a glance at the cool styles they put together. It&#8217;s a unique site built with completely open, ready to use in any publication, typeface downloads. One of our favorites – League Gothic – recently had some updates and new additions to its library. Of course we&#8217;re excited! Why? Because &#8216;League Gothic&#8217; is used on this website on the home page.
