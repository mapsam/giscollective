The second volume of the Atlas of Design is now available! You can order the book at the new [NACIS website](http://nacis.org). The volume consists of **32 maps** created by some of the world&#8217;s most distinguished cartographers (there is a [list of all of the contributors](http://atlasofdesign.org/2014/05/19/congratulations-to-our-finalists/)). Congratulations to the contributors and the editors for another great edition and continuing this great tradition of compiling these great maps. You can [take a look](http://atlasofdesign.org/2014/10/07/volume-2-sneak-peak/) at some of the maps at their blog.
