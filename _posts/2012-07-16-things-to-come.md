Make sure to keep following the [tumblr blog](http://gistudentcollective.tumblr.com/) on our posts! We&#8217;re not letting go of it too quickly mainly because we want things on this site to be working perfectly before we get everyone else involved. For now, you should check out a really cool personal site of the front-liner of the [D3 javascript](http://d3js.org/) visualization library, [Mike Bostock](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/). His posts combine some pretty incredible code to do some fun and useful tricks that are incorporated into data visualization (data vis) and are being incorporated into the geographic community.
