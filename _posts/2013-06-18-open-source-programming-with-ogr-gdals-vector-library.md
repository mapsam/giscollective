I decided it could be beneficial to the community to provide the geoprocessing scripts I created using GDAL&#8217;s vector library, OGR, after a member of the [GIS and Geography](http://www.linkedin.com/groups/GIS-Geography-3887350?trk=myg_ugrp_ovr) group on LinkedIn posted a question about geoprocessing with GDAL. GDAL/OGR can be a challenge to learn because of the scarcity of online examples, so I hope I am able to provide a little bit more to help those beginning to learn the ins and outs of GDAL and open source GIS programming.

I uploaded the example scripts to a](https://github.com/csterling/ogrTools) for everyone to access. I hope they can help provide insight into how one could best utilize the geoprocessing tools within GDAL.

The scripts in the repository show how to perform the following geoprocessing tasks with GDAL/OGR:
