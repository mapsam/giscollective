Lately, I have using the ArcGIS JavaScript API to develop internal web mapping applications. The applications are useful when they are in the browser, but the engineers generally had no way to print the map.

A question I often hear is, &#8220;Can you export this to PDF?&#8221;

After some research, I came across  [an example](http://stlouis.esri.com/apps/exportmap/) that allows the user to export the current map extent as a PDF.

Incorporating this feature into your web map will allow users to create custom maps from the web, and share it via email or print. Click [here](http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=8f16fdeef39c46b3952002b2d85ea5de) for more details.
