Happy Wednesday folks. Take a look at our newest tutorial, [Spatial Statistics](http://giscollective.org/tutorials/gis-techniques/spatial-statistics/), put together by **Chris Gavin** of the _University of Wisconsin-Madison_.

He managed to articulate some pretty confusing statistical concepts into simple descriptions and examples. The tutorials look at the following spatial analysis techniques.

  * Standard Distance
  * Anselin Local Moran&#8217;s I
  * Hot Spot Analysis
  * Average Nearest Neighbor
  * Spatial Autocorrelation

All of these come with practice data, which you can get from the &#8216;sample data&#8217; link on the page linked above. It will ask for a password â€“ give it &#8216;gisc&#8217; and that should grant you access to the internal FTP for a zip download with the geodatabase you&#8217;ll need for all five of the processes.

Here&#8217;s a big thanks to Chris for his work and knowledge.
