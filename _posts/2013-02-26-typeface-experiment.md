This is a quick project of mine to experiment with different typefaces and see how a variety of styles can work together towards a common theme. The quote is a simple translation I ran into during work. There is a tendency to choose one or two typefaces in projects in order to keep things straightforward for the viewer. This isn&#8217;t a bad philosophy to design by. Having too many different styles can make a graphic too complex and overwhelming to the eyes.

This graphic, though it basically lacks a hierarchy, takes on a challenge that many cartographers have: choosing typeface. The act of choosing a typeface should be as intentional as the projection you use. Different typefaces have different motion and appeal, which should work _with_ your design instead of against. The styles used take into account the idea of the word used to best portray the emotional or visual reaction that word creates. Mountains are sturdy and bold. Water flows and twists. Vast Plains stretch across the page. Kites take on crisp, geometric forms.Â In another graphic these typefaces would probably not work well together but in this they seem to work together to make the quote something more than before.

It is just a quote, though. Map typography should take into account the idea of the set of labels. Physical objects have different characteristics than political phenomena, which should be apparent in their descriptive text. All in all, remember that type is something that can make a great graphic seem intentional rather than lucky.
