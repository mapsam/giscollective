The Atlas of Design has opened its doors once again for those wanting to be a part of the beautiful world of cartography. Volume I was a great success that produced a hard cover publication showcasing some of the finest maps recently made.

You can [submit on their website](http://atlasofdesign.org/submissions) and all you need is your name, map title, email, map description, and a small file of your map to upload.

**Submissions are open until February 28th** so make sure to polish up your projects before then!
