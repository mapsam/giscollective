We have an updated example for our Leaflet 1 tutorial thanks to some incentive from [Matthew McKenna](https://github.com/mpmckenna8). Leaflet has undergone many changes recently, which rendered our original tutorials obsolete. We are currently restructuring with the 0.6 upgrade (0.6.4 more specifically). Check out the new [Setup and Basemap tutorial](http://giscollective.org/tutorials/web-mapping/leaflet-1/).

See a complete example of establishing a basemap using Leaflet at Matt&#8217;s Github repository: <https://github.com/mpmckenna8/leaflettuts>
