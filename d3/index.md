D3 is a javascript data visualization library made for modern web browsers. It introduces data into dynamically created SVG canvas elements. While D3 can be used for many information graphics, this series focuses on D3.Geo, which is the geographic component of the library. Most processes will have a live version running on [bl.ocks.org](http://bl.ocks.org/svmatthews), which runs files from [gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com/svmatthews).
