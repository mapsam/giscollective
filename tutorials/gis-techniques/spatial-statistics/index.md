This guide provides you with a &#8220;when and how&#8221; to use the most common techniques and spatial statistics used to detect relationships between feature data within ArcGIS. The techniques that will be highlighted in this tutorial are:

  1. [Standard Distance](http://giscollective.org/tutorials/gis-techniques/spatial-statistics/standard-distance/)
  2. [Anselin Local Moran&#8217;s I](http://giscollective.org/tutorials/gis-techniques/spatial-statistics/anselin-local-morans-i/)
  3. [Hot Spot Analysis (Getis-Ord Gi*)](http://giscollective.org/tutorials/gis-techniques/spatial-statistics/hot-spot-analysis/)
  4. [Average Nearest Neighbor](http://giscollective.org/tutorials/gis-techniques/spatial-statistics/average-nearest-neighbor/)
  5. [Spatial Autocorrelation (Global Moran&#8217;s I)](http://giscollective.org/tutorials/gis-techniques/spatial-statistics/spatial-autocorrelation)

To try it yourself us this [sample data](ftp://u68043146-mapsam@mapsam.com/gisc/downloads/SpatialStats_SampleData.zip).

_**Important**_: _Since most of the tools highlighted in this tutorial require the user to make choices for each of the input fields, it is extremely important to understand your data and the nature of each choice. These exercises largely used the default values as examples, but do not take this to mean that the default values should always be used. Make logical and informed decisions._
