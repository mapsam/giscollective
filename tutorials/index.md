## Web Mapping

**General**

  1. [Basemap APIs](http://www.mapsam.com/mugs/apis) &#8211; Visual comparisons and available code for copying and starting your map quickly
  2. [Local Server Environment](http://giscollective.org/local-server-environment-setup/) &#8211; MAMP Setup

**D3: Data Driven Documents.** D3 is a javascript data visualization library made for modern web browsers. It introduces data into dynamically created SVG canvas elements. While D3 can be used for many information graphics, this series focuses on D3.Geo, which is the geographic component of the library. Most processes will have a live version running on [bl.ocks.org](http://bl.ocks.org/svmatthews), which runs files from [gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com/svmatthews).

  * [Introduction & Setup](http://giscollective.org/d3-introduction-and-setup/) &#8211; Establish your D3 environment on your local computer for testing and creating your products before pushing them live.</span>
  * Topojson
  * [Basemap](http://giscollective.org/d3-basemap-with-topojson/)
  * Projections
  * [Topojson Interaction](http://giscollective.org/d3-topojson-interaction/)
  * [Queue.js](http://giscollective.org/d3-queue-js/)
  * Labels
  * Proportional Symbols

## GIS Techniques

There&#8217;s a lot you can do with your GIS software. Learning it all at once is impractical. These helpful tutorials go through, step-by-step, specific techniques and technologies related to the software. These will focus on ArcMap and QGIS specifically in efforts to cover the private and open-source GIS world.

**General**

  * [Attribute Selection &#8211; Partial String Search and Field Data Type Conversion in ArcGIS](http://giscollective.org/attribute-selection-partial-string-search/)
  * [Processing LiDAR Data with ArcGIS](http://giscollective.org/tutorials/gis-techniques/bringing-lidar-data-into-arcgis/)
  * [Spatial Data Conversion Using the Command Line](http://giscollective.org/spatial-data-conversion-using-python/)
  * [Definition Queries in ArcGIS](http://giscollective.org/tutorials/gis-techniques/definition-query/)
  * [Creating Custom Tools in ArcGIS &#8211; Model Builder](http://giscollective.org/tutorials/gis-techniques/creating-custom-tools-in-arcgis-model-builder/)
  * [Generating CAD Files from GIS Data](http://giscollective.org/tutorials/gis-techniques/generating-cad-files-from-gis-data/)
  * [Using ArcGIS Android to Show Device Location on Map](http://giscollective.org/using-arcgis-android-sdk-to-show-device-location-on-map/)

**Spatial Statistics.** This guide provides you with a “when and how” to use the most common techniques and spatial statistics used to detect relationships between feature data within ArcGIS. The techniques that will be highlighted in this tutorial are:

  * [Standard Distance](http://giscollective.org/tutorials/gis-techniques/spatial-statistics/standard-distance/)
  * [Anselin Local Moran&#8217;s I](http://giscollective.org/tutorials/gis-techniques/spatial-statistics/anselin-local-morans-i/)
  * [Hot Spot Analysis (Getis-Ord Gi*)](http://giscollective.org/tutorials/gis-techniques/spatial-statistics/hot-spot-analysis/)
  * [Average Nearest Neighbor](http://giscollective.org/tutorials/gis-techniques/spatial-statistics/average-nearest-neighbor/)
  * [Spatial Autocorrelation (Global Moran&#8217;s I)](http://giscollective.org/tutorials/gis-techniques/spatial-statistics/spatial-autocorrelation/)
