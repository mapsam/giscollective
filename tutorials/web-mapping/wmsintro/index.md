_An educational series by [Carl Sack](https://mywebspace.wisc.edu/cmsack/web/), July, 2012._

Welcome to my introductory series on web map services. These aren&#8217;t designed to be comprehensive, but rather are a beginner&#8217;s guide to what&#8217;s out there that I&#8217;ve been researching (as a beginner) over the past few weeks. It is a &#8220;living document&#8221; to which there may be future updates as I learn more. I was prompted to put it together by a need I had for work that was unfulfilled by any current resource I could find on the web or in print. I hope that it can prove useful for those just getting started with web maps and not sure what to use given the dizzying and quickly-growing slew of tools available.

The work that made this series possible was funded by the [University of Wisconsin Sea Grant Institute](http://www.seagrant.wisc.edu/home/). The original posts can also be viewed on the [Wisconsin Coastal Atlas Blog](http://wicoastalatlas.wordpress.com/).
