The world of pasting. **Command+V**. A pretty basic concept; copy an item and duplicate it. When you bring layers into the equation, much like photoshop and illustrator, pasting can take on new dimensions. This brings us to our keyboard shortcuts involving paste options.

First, is going to be an object-related paste. This means the duplication of your object and its pasting location is dependent on the object you are copying. **Pasting in front** of the object **(Command+F)** will put the new object directly on top of your original with the exact same ‘coordinates’. Very similarly, **pasting behind (Command+B)** will put the new object beneath the original, with the very same coordinates.

Another, and quite useful paste technique is **paste-in-place (Shift+Command+V)**. Pasting in place will be useful on two occasions; first, if you plan to copy from one layer and want to paste the object in the same place but in a new layer, paste in place will do just that as long as your are selected on the layer you wish to copy to. Second, if you are going between two related documents and want to paste an object in the same location as it’s original except on a new page, this command will work well. You can also use Command+F/B here as well.

`Paste - Command+V<br />
Paste in front - Command+F<br />
Paste behind - Command+B<br />
Paste in place - Shift+Command+V`
