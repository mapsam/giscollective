This week we’re going to look at some keyboard shortcuts that allow you to quickly manipulate your fill and stroke in Adobe Illustrator and InDesign. Long past are the days of which you finagle your cursor to switch from fill to stroke by clicking that little half-box. To start things off, let’s just work with alternating between fill and stroke. Keyboard button ‘X’ will do exactly this. Try it out, notice that fill and stroke have never switched in an easier way.

Now, X is a good start. But there is always more to the root key than just a simple tap. One of the more efficient things about Illustrator is that each tool has a key and each key has options, which usually involve pressing the shift/alt./command/option buttons in sync. Below are a few more helpful shortcuts:
  
[code]
  
X = alternates between fill and stroke
  
Shift+X = reverses fill and stroke
  
D = reverts selected object to white fill and black stroke
  
/ = gives no fill to either fill or stroke, whichever is in the current selection
  
< = color fill to selected object > = gradient fill to selected object
  
[/code]
  
There you have it. These shortcuts make working with your object’s color properties much more efficient. Happy Tuesday, folks. Enjoy your 4th of July!
