Welcome to the first ‘hotKey weekly’ post: the weekly post sharing our favorite, most-efficient, hotkeys for our cartographic information creation. Our intention here is to slowly open the world of keyboard shortcuts that make your work more efficient, but also add a little pizazz into your motion. It not only helps with efficiency, it simply makes some tasks easier than relying on the mouse alone.

Our first stop on the endless train of keyboard shortcuts will be pretty basic. We’re talking object selection tools (Adobe Illustrator/InDesign). Rid yourself of the motion memory between your hand and the mouse. Alternating between your selection tool and direct selection tool can become quite tedious when you’re moving the cursor back and forth between your objects and the corner of your screen. Simply use the ‘v’ key for your selection tool and the ‘a’ key for your direct selection tool.

A simple, yet powerful quirk in your keyboard.
